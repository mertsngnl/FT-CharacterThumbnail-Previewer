#  FlashThemes Character Thumbnail ID Previewer

This was in development since March, but now you can use it to preview character ID from minimium to maximium.

## How to use this.
First, you should do something like
```
(1) = Minimium
(10) = Maximium
```

You can use this tool to calculate and view how much characters you want to see by putting any of character ID and addition for more characters.
